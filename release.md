## TextTemplateManager {{VERSION}}

A hotkey-driven text-template paste tool for Windows: organize reusable snippets in folders, give them shortcuts, and paste them into any application from a global Quick Paste window.

### Install

Get **TextTemplateManager** from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NMBSZLLLN6V). The Store installs and updates it; no administrator rights are needed. In a company it can also be deployed with winget or Intune (see the Administrator & Deployment Guide below).

Coming from TextTemplateManager 1: your templates and settings are backed up at the first start and imported in one step if you choose so; version 1's data folder is left as it was.

> **Note — Remote Desktop (RDP):** If TextTemplateManager runs on both your local computer and a remote computer you connect to over RDP, the global Quick Paste hotkey always opens Quick Paste on the **local** computer — Windows delivers a registered global hotkey locally, so it never reaches the remote session. Give each machine a **different** Quick Paste hotkey, or run only one instance, to avoid the clash.

### What's new in this release

One switch for automatic updates.

#### Improved

- **Automatic updates, one switch.** **Settings ▸ General ▸ Updates** no longer has a separate **Keep updating when automatic Store updates are off**. **Check for and download updates automatically** covers it: where automatic Store updates are turned off on the PC and the organization allows it, TextTemplateManager still downloads its own updates (through winget), and a note under the switch says so. With the switch off, the update notice offers **Download** as before.
- **For administrators:** on PCs where "Turn off Automatic Download and Install of updates" is set, TextTemplateManager now keeps updating itself by default, because the switch is on by default. To keep the Store policy final for this app, set `AllowUpdateDespiteStorePolicy` = 0 under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Marflow Software\TextTemplateManager`; `AutomaticUpdates` = 0 leaves only **Check for updates**. See the Administrator & Deployment Guide.

{{CHANGELOG}}

### Uninstall / reset

In Windows **Settings ▸ Apps ▸ Installed apps ▸ TextTemplateManager ▸ …**: **Advanced options** offers **Reset** (deletes the app's data) and **Repair**; **Uninstall** removes the app and its data. With PowerShell:

    Get-AppxPackage *TextTemplateManager* | Remove-AppxPackage

The backups in `Documents\TextTemplateManager\Backups` stay; delete them by hand if you no longer need them.

### Browser extension

Pair TextTemplateManager with the companion **TTM-Connect** extension to list and paste your templates from your browser:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jclopjpjdldbknjdhmjldehlkgbihlmi)
- [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ttm-connect/fbpmhopmnaoedcnbegdkpfblekhaindm)
